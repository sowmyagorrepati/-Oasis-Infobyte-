# Login & Register
I have created a fully responsive login and registration system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how it works:

**Features**
**Registration Page:** Allows users to register with a valid email and password. It displays a message upon successful registration.

**Login Page:** Validates the entered email and password. If the user tries to log in without registering, it displays an error message stating "Username not registered."

**Secured Page:** Accessible only to registered users. Upon successful login, users are redirected to this secured page.

**Local Storage:** Stores registered users' data using JavaScript's localStorage. During login, it validates the entered credentials against this stored data.
